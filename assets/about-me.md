## ‚öôÔ∏è Stack

<stackIcons>  
</stackIcons>  

My preferred languages are **C++**, **TypeScript**, and **Python**, with a strong appreciation for rigorous type systems.
I also plan to explore **Rust, Scala, and Julia** in the future.

I am comfortable across paradigms ‚Äî **object-oriented, functional, and reactive programming** ‚Äî and enjoy selecting 
the right approach for the problem at hand.

For **scientific projects**, I make extensive use of the **Python scientific stack**, leveraging its ecosystem for 
modeling, data analysis, and visualization.

For **desktop UI**, my main tool is **Qt**, while for the **web** I work across both frontend and backend.
I particularly enjoy building interfaces with **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**, and exploring cloud-native solutions with **Kubernetes**.
I also experiment with **WebAssembly** and **Pyodide** to bring C++ and Python directly into the browser.

Some of the open-source tools and libraries I frequently rely on include 
**RxJS, D3.js, Three.js, Angular, Webpack, Qt, Eigen, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, FastAPI, MyPy, and Pydantic**;
‚Äîbig ups to the open-source community!üôè‚Äî

## ‚öõÔ∏è Science

Below is an overview of my scientific background, largely developed through academic research.
For details on degrees and education, see the page <cross-link target="education">education</cross-link>.

My expertise lies in **quantum chemistry** for small atomic systems, a journey that began with my **thesis** at Bordeaux 1 University in the LCTS laboratory.

I worked on **ab-initio quantum computations** to calculate statistical properties such as **thermodynamic data** and **reaction rates**. These methods, grounded in first principles, enabled me to describe electronic structures and molecular interactions, and to predict chemical properties and reaction outcomes. By combining these calculations with statistical mechanics, I connected quantum-level models to macroscopic observables, providing insights into the fundamental behavior of atomic systems.

A central challenge in modeling is the proper management of **uncertainties**‚Äîarising from model approximations and experimental data acquisition‚Äîespecially in multidisciplinary and multiscale contexts. During my **post-doctoral fellowship** at the PECOS laboratory in Austin, Texas, I gained hands-on experience with **Bayesian inference** for uncertainty quantification and propagation. I had hoped to pursue this further, particularly in **Bayesian experimental design**, but circumstances prevented me from joining CNRS üòî. On the positive side, this transition marked the start of my career in **software engineering** üòÑ.

As an illustration of this work, one of my articles was published in the **Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation** üéâ:

<note level='info' title="Machine Learning & AI" expandable="true">
Beyond quantum chemistry, I have applied machine learning techniques, primarily in signal processing.
I‚Äôve completed several certifications (including Andrew Ng‚Äôs courses) that reinforced my understanding of both 
theory and practice.

Today, I have the background and intuition to address **moderately difficult ML problems**, and I remain eager to 
deepen my expertise and apply these methods to real-world challenges.

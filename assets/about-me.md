## ‚öôÔ∏è Stack

<stackIcons>
</stackIcons>


My favorite languages are **C++**, **TypeScript**, and **Python**. Give me a rigorous type system, and I‚Äôm happy!
I‚Äôd also love to explore **Rust, Scala, and Julia** when time allows. I‚Äôm not particularly religious about programming 
paradigms‚ÄîI enjoy **object-oriented, functional, and reactive programming** alike.

I especially enjoy **science-related projects**, where I can leverage the full power of the **Python scientific stack**.

**For desktop UI**, I mainly work with **Qt**, but I get the most fun out of building web interfaces with
**HTML/CSS/JavaScript**. Messy? Sometimes. Powerful? Absolutely.

**When it comes to the web**, I‚Äôm equally comfortable on the backend and enjoy exploring the wildness
of **Kubernetes** and modern cloud-native infrastructure.
I also love experimenting with **WebAssembly** and **Pyodide** to bring C++ and Python into web-browsers.

My favorite libraries and frameworks‚Äîbig ups to the open-source community!üôè‚Äîinclude: **RxJS, D3.js, Three.js, 
Angular (though I wish I had used React), Webpack, Qt, Eigen, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, FastAPI, MyPy, Pydantic**, 
and probably more.

## ‚öõÔ∏è Science

Below is my story in the domain of science, largely supported by scholarship. 
For details regarding formations and degrees, see the page
<cross-link target="education">education</cross-link>.


<thesisImg>
</thesisImg>

My expertise lies in **quantum chemistry** for small atomic systems, a journey that began with my **thesis** at 
Bordeaux 1 University in the LCTS laboratory.

I focused on **ab-initio quantum computations** to calculate statistical properties such as **thermodynamic data** and 
**reaction rates**. This work involved applying first-principles methods to describe electronic structures and
molecular interactions, allowing me to predict chemical properties and reaction outcomes. 
By combining these computations with statistical mechanics, I was able to link quantum-level calculations to 
macroscopic observables, providing insights into the fundamental behavior of small atomic systems.

In modeling, proper management of **uncertainties**‚Äîarising from model approximations and experimental data 
acquisition‚Äîis crucial for accurate results, especially in multidisciplinary and multiscale problems. 
During my **post-doctoral fellowship** at the PECOS laboratory in Austin, Texas, I gained hands-on experience 
in **Bayesian inference** for uncertainty quantification and propagation. I had hoped to continue this research,
particularly in **Bayesian experimental design**, but that journey was interrupted when I was unable to 
join the CNRS üòî. On the bright side, this marked the beginning of my journey into **software engineering** üòÑ.

If I have to pick an article I wrote to illustrate this discussion, I‚Äôm happy to share this one, published in
 the **Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation** üéâ:

**Machine Learning & IA**

I have experience applying machine learning techniques, primarily in the domain of signal processing. 
I‚Äôve completed couple certifications (including Andrew Ng‚Äôs courses) that strengthened my understanding of foundational 
concepts and practical workflows.

I have a solid intuition and background to tackle moderately difficult ML problems, and I‚Äôm eager to continue learning 
and applying these skills to real-world challenges.

## <icon target="youwol"></icon> <icon target="w3nest"></icon> Full-Stack Architect & Frontend Developer

*<ext-link target="youwol">YouWol</ext-link> & <ext-link target="w3nest">W3Nest</ext-link> — 
 <icon target="calendar"></icon> 2020–2025 — <icon target="location"></icon> Montpellier*

Started as **lead developer and manager** of the YouWol Platform, coordinating **frontend, backend & devops** 
development.
Worked closely with a DevOps engineer and later mentored a junior frontend developer.
When the company discontinued the platform branch, I continued it independently as 
**W3Nest**, taking full ownership of **architecture, development, and deployment**.

<note level="question" title="Why YouWol & W3Nest ?" expandable="true">  
YouWol – startup focused on next-generation R&D frameworks and geoscience technologies.  
I was hired from the beginning to design and implement the platform.  
When the company discontinued this branch, I continued the project independently as W3Nest (with their agreement), building on the architecture I had designed. My focus was to refine and make production-ready a suite of innovative tools for **scientific and modular web applications**.

**Key Realizations**

* **<ext-link target="webpm">WebPM</ext-link>**: package manager for the Web with **dependency resolution and dynamic 
  linking** across ESM, Python-in-Browser, and backend packages.

* **<ext-link target="mkdocs-ts">MkDocs-TS</ext-link>**: documentation framework with **notebook-like features** for 
  technical and scientific writing.

* **<ext-link target="vs-flow">Visual Studio Flow</ext-link>**: modern **low-code** library for 
  **visual reactive workflows** — simple, powerful, and modular.

* **<ext-link target="rx-vdom">Rx-vDOM</ext-link>**: **reactive DOM library** leveraging reactive programming principles 
  for dynamic UI generation.

* Designed and deployed backend services on **Google Cloud** and later **OVH Cloud**, ensuring scalability and 
  reliability.
  
* Architected data/storage solutions with **ScyllaDB (NoSQL)**, **MinIO (persistent storage)**, and **Redis (caching)**
  for large-scale scientific workflows.
  
* Deployed a **cost-effective Kubernetes cluster** (OVH) with authentication (**Keycloak**) and monitoring 
  (**Grafana, Prometheus**).

##  <icon target="slb"></icon> Software Designer

*<ext-link target="slb">SLB</ext-link> (formerly Schlumberger) — <icon target="calendar"></icon> 2014–2020 — 
<icon target="location"></icon> Montpellier*

**Key Realizations**

* Rewrote a **100k-line C++ signal processing library** (after the departure of its original expert maintainer), 
  reducing the codebase by \~80% while **improving robustness, maintainability, and ease of integration**.

* Contributed to a **C++/Qt desktop application for gas chromatography analysis**, leading the redesign of the 
  **workflow builder** to enhance modularity and reliability.

* Joined the **Digital Transformation team** to develop *Rapid Screening*, a big-data web app visualizing 
  **1M+ wellbore data points** on an interactive map; also contributed R\&D on **clustering algorithms**.

* Collaborated with R\&D on **machine learning–based algorithms** for 1D signal pattern recognition, iterating
  on model design and integration.

* Led multiple **innovation projects** during SLB’s annual *Innovation Week*, delivering prototypes that 
  explored **new technologies and workflows**.
